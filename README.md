# Programming Best Practice

## Minimizing mutable states
- [Constness and Immutability](./ConstnessAndImmutability.md)
- Functional programming

## Code as comments
- Utilizing variable/function names
- Appropriate typing

## Testing
- No logic in assertion
- Static testing content
- Arrange/Act/Assert
- Mock dependency
- Parameterized test

## Others
- Result/Error/Status type
- Shallow data flow
